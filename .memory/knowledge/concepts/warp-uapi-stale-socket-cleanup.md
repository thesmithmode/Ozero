# WARP UAPI Socket: Stale File Regression and Cleanup Pattern

A regression introduced in commit `bd6a178a` (2026-05-20) caused WARP `awaitReady` to timeout on every attempt due to stale `.sock` files in `$dataDir/sockets/`. The amneziawg-go fork creates `tunN.sock` where N is the kernel-assigned TUN interface name (not the user-chosen tunnel name). Old socket files from previous sessions persist on disk after the process exits, because Unix domain socket files are not auto-deleted when the process dies.

## Key Points

- amneziawg-go fork socket path: `$dataDir/sockets/<kernel-tun-name>.sock` (e.g., `tun0.sock`, `tun5.sock`). Kernel assigns the name; it may differ from our chosen tunnel name `ozero-warp`
- `RealWarpSdkBridge.attachTun` pre-`bd6a178a` cleaned only `uapiPath/$tunnelName.sock` (legacy path) — `sockets/*.sock` were never cleaned
- Stale `tunN.sock` accumulate across sessions. On next start, Go creates `tunM.sock`, but `findUapiSocket` using `firstOrNull` (lexicographic order) returned the stale file → `LocalSocket.connect()` → ECONNREFUSED → handshake poll all fail → 10s timeout → `Failed`
- Diagnostic log signature: `[sockets/]={tun5.sock,tun0.sock}` — multiple `.sock` files, oldest is stale
- Fix: delete ALL `*.sock` in `sockets/` BEFORE `awgTurnOn`. Use `maxByOrNull { lastModified() }` instead of `firstOrNull` for resilience if cleanup races

## Details

### Root Cause Chain

`bd6a178a` added `findUapiSocket()` with cascade discovery: try `sockets/<tunnelName>.sock`, then `sockets/` listFiles, then legacy path. The discovery was correct, but `attachTun()` only cleaned the legacy path. After the Go process exited, the `tunN.sock` file remained at `$dataDir/sockets/tunN.sock`. On the next session, Go created a new socket at `$dataDir/sockets/tunM.sock` (different N). The `sockets/` directory now contained two files: old stale `tunN.sock` and new live `tunM.sock`. `firstOrNull` on `listFiles()` is lexicographic — on typical systems `tun0.sock` sorts before `tun5.sock`, so the stale file was returned when the new number was higher.

Unix domain socket files are filesystem objects — a `.sock` file does NOT disappear when the process that created it exits. Only explicit `unlink()` removes it. The Go runtime does not call `unlink()` on signal exit (SIGKILL path) or normal process death from Android process lifecycle.

### Fix (commit f458dd5d)

Two changes applied together:

1. **Pre-start cleanup** in `RealWarpSdkBridge.attachTun`: list `sockets/` directory, delete all files ending in `.sock` before calling `awgTurnOn`. This ensures Go starts with a clean directory and `findUapiSocket` finds only the freshly created file.

2. **Newest-file selection** in `WarpHandshakeUapi.findUapiSocket`: replace `firstOrNull()` (lexicographic) with `maxByOrNull { lastModified() }` (most recently created). This is a defense-in-depth change — even if cleanup fails (race condition, IO error), the newest file is the live one.

```kotlin
// Before (regression):
val socketFile = socketsDir.listFiles()?.firstOrNull { it.extension == "sock" }

// After (fix):
socketsDir.listFiles { f -> f.extension == "sock" }?.forEach { it.delete() }  // cleanup
// ... awgTurnOn ...
val socketFile = socketsDir.listFiles { f -> f.extension == "sock" }
    ?.maxByOrNull { it.lastModified() }  // newest = live
```

### General Pattern

Any time a native library (Go, C++) writes a Unix domain socket (`*.sock` file) to a directory:
- The file persists after process death
- Multiple files in the same directory after crashes = stale files
- Selection strategy must handle staleness: prefer newest, or clean before create

This applies equally to `wireguard-go` forks and any other Go/C native library that uses UAPI-style sockets.

### EADDRINUSE on Bind: Second Stale Socket Variant

A second manifestation of the stale socket problem involves the UAPI server socket bind path (e.g., `ozero-warp.sock` at `$dataDir/ozero-warp.sock`). If WARP crashes without cleanup, this file persists. On the next start, `awgTurnOn` attempts to `bind()` a new Unix domain socket at the same path, gets `EADDRINUSE`, and returns `-1`. The symptom is identical to the blocking-fd failure: stable -1 on every retry.

Fix: explicitly delete `$dataDir/ozero-warp.sock` (and equivalent named sockets) immediately before calling `awgTurnOn`. This is independent of the `sockets/tunN.sock` cleanup described above — both must be performed.

- [[concepts/go-runtime-process-isolation]] — WARP process isolation; Go process death leaves socket files behind
- [[concepts/engine-await-ready-pattern]] — awaitReady() timeout that surfaced this regression
- [[concepts/warp-false-connected-no-handshake]] — False failure vs false connected; stale socket caused false failure (timeout = Failed, not connected)
- [[concepts/warp-awgturnon-blocking-fd]] — Other cause of stable awgTurnOn=-1; both must be checked when diagnosing -1 failures
